====================

  

Overview
--------

This is a 2D game I created in Python using Pygame and MoviePy, with cutscenes made in After Effects. The game was built to learn Python from scratch and explore 2D game development.

  

Game Concept
------------

*   You are a visitor in an abandoned hotel being chased by a monster.
    
*    There are 5 floors; your goal is to collect 3 keys to escape.
    
*    Floors contain keys, empty rooms, or encounters with the monster.
    
*    Use the elevator and various in-game mechanics to survive and escape.

  

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   Python (core logic and game mechanics)
    
*    Pygame (2D game rendering)
    
*    MoviePy (displaying cutscenes)
    
*    After Effects (animations/cutscenes)
    
*    AI-generated assets (via ChatGPT)
  

Development & Learning
----------------------

Total development time: ~55 hours (20 hours building logic, 35 hours implementing visuals).

Focused on learning Python, game mechanics, and integrating media into a playable game.

Gained experience with 2D game design, event handling, and multimedia integration.

  

How to Play
-----------

Press F5 to run the game.  
Use arrow keys to dodge spikes, TAB to view stats, and click glowing buttons to navigate floors.  
Collect keys, avoid the monster, and try to escape the hotel.
