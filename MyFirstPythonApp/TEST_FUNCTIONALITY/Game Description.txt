--WELCOME--

The basis of the game:

	- You are a visitor in an abandoned hotel
	- Oh no! There is a monster chasing you!!!!
	- The game starts with you in the elevator
	- There are 5 floors in the hotel
	- You must grab 3 keys to get out of the hotel

In each floor:

	You could either get
		a key!!! this brings you back to the elevator and one step closer to escaping. The monster does not move
		nothing... this allows you to hide and let the monster move before you are back in the elevator
		the monster!!! if you manage to beat him quickly you get to escape to the elevator. if not then it is game over
			-note: if you do escape then the monster moves too
